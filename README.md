In this repo is a small gluon arm project, which added an gripper, and try to to make the arm move acording to the recognized body pose.
It subscribes the openpose ros package msg and move accordingly.
This is initially uploaded to share with friends, so the readme info is rough, if more friends are interested, this will be updated more detail.
